      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3650">'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns and her family. Nicknamed Demdike, suggesting that she was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204}}{{efn|name=Demdike}} Elizabeth was the head of the family and one of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612, in which her daughter Elizabeth Device, her granddaughter Alizon Device, and her grandson James Device were all found guilty of causing harm by witchcraft and executed at at Gallows Hill&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; in Lancaster on 20&amp;nbsp;August 1612; Elizabeth herself died in prison while awaiting trial.{{sfn|Hasted|1993|p=23|ps=}}

Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history, which took place on [[Good Friday]] 6 April 1612.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} As a result of an inquiry undertaken by local magistrates into the events of that day eight of those attending the meeting were accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at Lancaster Assizes and one at Yourk Assizes.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot; or &quot;Maud&quot;, a term for a poor or shabby woman, and a term for a cat, particularly an old cat as in &quot;grimalkin&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39}} Malkin Tower is believed to have been near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]],&lt;ref name=FieldsP60&gt;{{Harvnb|Fields|1998|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; or possibly in Blacko on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm,&lt;ref name=ClaytonP286&gt;{{Harvnb|Clayton|2007|p=286}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to have been demolished soon after the trials;&lt;ref name=FieldsP60/&gt; it was not uncommon at the time to quickly demolish empty buildings and recycle the materials.

In December 2011 it was announced that water engineers had unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to Lower Black Moss reservoir. Local historians have speculated that it might be the lost Malkin Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;

Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history, which took place on [[Good Friday]] 6 April 1612.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} As a result of an inquiry undertaken by local magistrates into the events of that day eight of those attending the meeting were accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at Lancaster Assizes and one at York Assizes.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot; or &quot;Maud&quot;; a term for a poor or shabby woman; and a term for a cat, particularly an old cat as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[Malt kiln]].{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}}

Malkin Tower may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials, but its location is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39A|ps=}}. The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only ever describes it as being in the forest of Pendle. The former [[royal forest]] covers a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending to edges of the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]] on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} another is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} In December 2011 it was announced that water engineers had unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]], which local historians have speculated might be the lost Malkin Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

==Name==
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot; or &quot;Maud&quot;; a term for a poor or shabby woman; and a term for a cat, particularly an old cat as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which the witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a swipe at the family that resided there,{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14}} although local historian Arthur Douglas considered this unlikely due to the poor education of the people in the area during that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[Malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} or &quot;mawkin&quot;, an old word for a lower-class woman or a slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14}}

It is likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was in reality a simple cottage, rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell proposes that the witches' home was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25}} It is therefore possible that &quot;Tower&quot; was in fact a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14}}

==Location==
[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Lower Black Moss Reservoir (on the left), one of the suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=photograph]]
Malkin Tower may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} and recycle the materials, but its location is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only ever describes it as being in the forest of Pendle. The former [[royal forest]] covers a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending to edges of the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]] on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the Cross Gaits Inn public house, and the tower is featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22}} Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]];{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that the area now known as Sadler's Farm was the site of Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}} Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, although nothing has yet been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25}}

A potential candidate was discovered in December 2011, when it was announced that water engineers had unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]], which local historians have speculated might be the lost Malkin Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history, which took place on [[Good Friday]] 6 April 1612.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} As a result of an inquiry undertaken by local magistrates into the events of that day eight of those attending the meeting were accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at Lancaster Assizes and one at York Assizes.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Name==
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot; or &quot;Maud&quot;; a term for a poor or shabby woman; and a term for a cat, particularly an old cat as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which the witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a swipe at the family that resided there,{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14}} although local historian Arthur Douglas considered this unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area during that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[Malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} or &quot;mawkin&quot;, an old word for a lower-class woman or a slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14}}

It is likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was in reality a simple cottage, rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell proposes that the witches' home was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25}} It is therefore possible that &quot;Tower&quot; was in fact a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14}}

Malkin Tower may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} and recycle the materials, but its location is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only ever describes it as being in the forest of Pendle. The former [[royal forest]] covers a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending to edges of the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]] on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the Cross Gaits Inn public house, and the tower is featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22}} Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]];{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that the area now known as Sadler's Farm was the site of Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}} Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, although nothing has yet been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25}}

A potential candidate was discovered in December 2011, when it was announced that water engineers had unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]], which local historians have speculated might be the lost Malkin Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} As a result of an inquiry undertaken by local magistrates into the events of that day eight of those attending the meeting were accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at Lancaster Assizes and one at York Assizes.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Name==
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot; or &quot;Maud&quot;; a term for a poor or shabby woman; and a term for a cat, particularly an old cat as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which the witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a swipe at the family that resided there,{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14}} although local historian Arthur Douglas considered this unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area during that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[Malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} or &quot;mawkin&quot;, an old word for a lower-class woman or a slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14}}

It is likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was in reality a simple cottage, rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25}} It is therefore possible that &quot;Tower&quot; was in fact a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} As a result of an inquiry undertaken by local magistrates into the events of that day eight of those attending the meeting were accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at Lancaster Assizes and one at York Assizes.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Name==
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot; or &quot;Maud&quot;; a term for a poor or shabby woman; and a term for a cat, particularly an old cat as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which the witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a swipe at the family that resided there,{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14}} although local historian Arthur Douglas considered this unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area during that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[Malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} or &quot;mawkin&quot;, an old word for a lower-class woman or a slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

It is likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was in reality a simple cottage, rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} It is therefore possible that &quot;Tower&quot; was in fact a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

Malkin Tower may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} and recycle the materials, but its location is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only ever describes it as being in the forest of Pendle. The former [[royal forest]] covers a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending to edges of the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]] on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]], and the tower is featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]];{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that the area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}} Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has yet been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}}

A potential candidate was discovered in December 2011, when it was announced that water engineers had unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]], which local historians have speculated might be the lost Malkin Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot; or &quot;Maud&quot;; a term for a poor or shabby woman; and a term for a cat, particularly an old cat as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which the witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a swipe at the family that resided there,{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considered unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[Malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} or &quot;mawkin&quot;, an old word for a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} As a result of an inquiry undertaken by local magistrates into the events of that day eight of those attending the meeting were accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at Lancaster Assizes and one at York Assizes.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Name==
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot; or &quot;Maud&quot;; a term for a poor or shabby woman; and a term for a cat, particularly an old cat as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which the witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a swipe at the family that resided there,{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considered unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[Malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} or &quot;mawkin&quot;, an old word for a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

It is likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was in reality a simple cottage, rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} It is therefore possible that &quot;Tower&quot; was in fact a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

Malkin Tower may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9178">'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} Elizabeth and Alizon were two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612, in which they and two other members of their family&amp;nbsp;– Alizon's daughter Elizabeth Device and her son James Device&amp;nbsp;– were all found guilty of causing harm by witchcraft and executed at Gallows Hill&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; in Lancaster on 20&amp;nbsp;August 1612; Elizabeth herself, who was in her eighties, died in prison while awaiting trial.{{sfn|Hasted|1993|p=23|ps=}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} As a result of an inquiry undertaken by local magistrates into the events of that day eight of those attending the meeting were accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at Lancaster Assizes and one at York Assizes.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Name==
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot; or &quot;Maud&quot;; a term for a poor or shabby woman; and a term for a cat, particularly an old cat as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which the witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a swipe at the family that resided there,{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considered unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[Malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} or &quot;mawkin&quot;, an old word for a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

It is likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was in reality a simple cottage, rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} It is therefore possible that &quot;Tower&quot; was in fact a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

==Location==
[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Lower Black Moss Reservoir (on the left), one of the suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=photograph]]
Malkin Tower may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials,{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} but its location is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only ever describes it as being in the forest of Pendle. The former [[royal forest]] covers a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending to edges of the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]] on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]], and the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary source of evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne, called Mawkin Yarde{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|p=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} and described as “in the north of Colne”.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} However this also causes a problem as by definition anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]];{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}} Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has yet been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}}

A potential candidate was discovered in December 2011, when it was announced that water engineers had unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]], which local historians have speculated might be the lost Malkin Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot; or &quot;Maud&quot;; a term for a poor or shabby woman; and a term for a cat, particularly an old cat as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which the witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a swipe at the family that resided there,{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considered unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[Malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} or &quot;mawkin&quot;, an old word for a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

It is likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was in reality a simple cottage, rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} It is therefore possible that &quot;Tower&quot; was in fact a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

==Location==
[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Lower Black Moss Reservoir (on the left), one of the suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=photograph]]
Malkin Tower may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials,{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} but its location is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]] on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]], and the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary source of evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne, called Mawkin Yarde{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|p=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} and described as “in the north of Colne”.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} However this also causes a problem as by definition anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]];{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}} Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has yet been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}}

A potential candidate was discovered in December 2011, when it was announced that water engineers had unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]], which local historians have speculated might be the lost Malkin Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} As a result of an inquiry undertaken by local magistrates into the events of that day eight of those attending the meeting were accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at Lancaster Assizes and one at York Assizes.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Name==
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot; or &quot;Maud&quot;; a term for a poor or shabby woman; and a term for a cat, particularly an old cat as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which the witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a swipe at the family that resided there,{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considered unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[Malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} or &quot;mawkin&quot;, an old word for a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

It is likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was in reality a simple cottage, rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} It is therefore possible that &quot;Tower&quot; was in fact a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

==Location==
[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Lower Black Moss Reservoir (on the left), one of the suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=photograph]]
Malkin Tower may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials,{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} but its location is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]], and the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary source of evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|p=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} and described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} However this also causes a problem as by definition anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9164">'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} Elizabeth and Alizon were two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612, in which they and two other members of their family&amp;nbsp;– Alizon's daughter Elizabeth Device and her son James Device&amp;nbsp;– were all found guilty of causing harm by witchcraft and executed at Gallows Hill&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; in Lancaster on 20&amp;nbsp;August 1612; Elizabeth herself, who was in her eighties, died in prison while awaiting trial.{{sfn|Hasted|1993|p=23|ps=}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} As a result of an inquiry undertaken by local magistrates into the events of that day eight of those attending the meeting were accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at Lancaster Assizes and one at York Assizes.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Name==
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot; or &quot;Maud&quot;; a term for a poor or shabby woman; and a term for a cat, particularly an old cat as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which the witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a swipe at the family that resided there,{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considered unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[Malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} or &quot;mawkin&quot;, an old word for a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

It is likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was in reality a simple cottage, rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} It is therefore possible that &quot;Tower&quot; was in fact a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

==Location==
[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Lower Black Moss Reservoir (on the left), one of the suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=photograph]]
Malkin Tower may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials,{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} but its location is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]], and the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary source of evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|p=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} and described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} However this also causes a problem as by definition anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]];{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}} Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has yet been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}}

A potential candidate was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]], which local historians have speculated might be the lost Malkin Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot; or &quot;Maud&quot;; a term for a poor or shabby woman; and a term for a cat, particularly an old cat as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which the witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a swipe at the family that resided there,{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considered unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[Malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} or &quot;mawkin&quot;, an old word for a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

It is likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was in reality a simple cottage, rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} It is therefore possible that &quot;Tower&quot; was in fact a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

==Location==
[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Lower Black Moss Reservoir (on the left), one of the suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=photograph]]
Malkin Tower may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials,{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} but its location is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]], and the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary source of evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|p=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} and described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} However this also causes a problem as by definition anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]];{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}} Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has yet been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}}

A further potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]];{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}} Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}}

A further potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9113">'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} Elizabeth and Alizon were two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612, in which they and two other members of their family&amp;nbsp;– Alizon's daughter Elizabeth Device and her son James Device&amp;nbsp;– were all found guilty of causing harm by witchcraft and executed at Gallows Hill&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; in Lancaster on 20&amp;nbsp;August 1612; Elizabeth herself, who was in her eighties, died in prison while awaiting trial.{{sfn|Hasted|1993|p=23|ps=}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} As a result of an inquiry undertaken by local magistrates into the events of that day eight of those attending the meeting were accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at Lancaster Assizes and one at York Assizes.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==[[Toponymy]]==
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot; or &quot;Maud&quot;; a term for a poor or shabby woman; and a term for a cat, particularly an old cat as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which the witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a swipe at the family that resided there,{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considered unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[Malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} or &quot;mawkin&quot;, an old word for a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

It is likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was in reality a simple cottage, rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} &quot;Tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

==Location==
[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Lower Black Moss Reservoir (on the left), one of the suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=photograph]]
Malkin Tower may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials,{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} but its location is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]], and the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary source of evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|p=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} and described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} However this also causes a problem as by definition anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9180">'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} Elizabeth and Alizon were two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612, in which they and two other members of their family&amp;nbsp;– Alizon's daughter Elizabeth Device and her son James Device&amp;nbsp;– were all found guilty of causing harm by witchcraft and executed at Gallows Hill&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; in Lancaster on 20&amp;nbsp;August 1612; Elizabeth herself, who was in her eighties, died in prison while awaiting trial.{{sfn|Hasted|1993|p=23|ps=}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} As a result of an inquiry undertaken by local magistrates into the events of that day eight of those attending the meeting were accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at Lancaster Assizes and one at York Assizes.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==[[Toponymy]]==
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which the witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a swipe at the family that resided there,{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considered unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}}

It is likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was in reality a simple cottage, rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} &quot;Tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

==Location==
[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Lower Black Moss Reservoir (on the left), one of the suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=photograph]]
Malkin Tower may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials,{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} but its location is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]], and the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary source of evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} and described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} However this also causes a problem as by definition anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]];{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}} Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}}

A further potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}}

It is likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was in reality a simple cottage, rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} &quot;Tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

==Location==
[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Lower Black Moss Reservoir (on the left), one of the suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=photograph]]
Malkin Tower may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials,{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} but its location is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]], and the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary source of evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} and described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} However this also causes a problem as by definition anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]];{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}} Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}}

A further potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]];{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}} Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}}

A further potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} Elizabeth and Alizon were two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612, in which they and two other members of their family&amp;nbsp;– Alizon's daughter Elizabeth Device and her son James Device&amp;nbsp;– were all found guilty of causing harm by witchcraft and executed at Gallows Hill&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; in Lancaster on 20&amp;nbsp;August 1612; Elizabeth herself, who was in her eighties, died in prison while awaiting trial.{{sfn|Hasted|1993|p=23|ps=}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} As a result of an inquiry undertaken by local magistrates into the events of that day eight of those attending the meeting were accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at Lancaster Assizes and one at York Assizes.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==History==
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}}

It is likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was in reality a simple cottage, rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} &quot;Tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

==Location==
Malkin Tower may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials,{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} but its location is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} As a result of an inquiry undertaken by local magistrates into the events of that day eight of those attending the meeting were accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at Lancaster Assizes and one at York Assizes.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==History==
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}}

It is likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage, rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} &quot;Tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her mother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her mother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two others.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}

==Location==
Malkin Tower may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials,{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} but its location is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]], and the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary source of evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} and described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} However this also causes a problem as by definition anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]];{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}} Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}}

A further potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}}

It is likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage, rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} &quot;Tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her mother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two others.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}

==Location==
Malkin Tower may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials,{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} but its location is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]], and the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary source of evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} and described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} However this also causes a problem as by definition anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]];{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}} Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}}

A further potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]], and the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary source of evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} and described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} However this also causes a problem as by definition anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]];{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}} Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} As a result of an inquiry undertaken by local magistrates into the events of that day eight of those attending the meeting were accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at Lancaster Assizes and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Elizabeth Southerns and Alizon Device were among those subsequently hanged at Gallows Hill in [[Lancaster]] on 20 August 1612.

==History==
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}}

It is likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage, rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} &quot;Tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her mother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two others.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} As a result of an inquiry undertaken by local magistrates into the events of that day eight of those attending the meeting were accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at Lancaster Assizes and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Elizabeth Southerns died in prison while awaiting trial, and Alizon Device was among those subsequently hanged at Gallows Hill in [[Lancaster]] on 20 August 1612.{{sfn|Hasted|1993|p=23|ps=}}

==History==
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}}

It is likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage, rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} &quot;Tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her mother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two others.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}

==Location==
Malkin Tower may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials,{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} but its location is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]], and the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary source of evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} and described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} However this also causes a problem as by definition anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]];{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}} Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}}

A further potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended the meeting were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at Lancaster Assizes and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Elizabeth Southerns died in prison while awaiting trial, and Alizon Device was among those found guilty and hanged at Gallows Hill in [[Lancaster]] on 20 August 1612.{{sfn|Hasted|1993|p=23|ps=}}

==History==
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}}

It is likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage, rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} &quot;Tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her mother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two others.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}

==Location==
Malkin Tower may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials,{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} but its location is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]], and the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary source of evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} and described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} However this also causes a problem as by definition anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]];{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}} Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}}

A further potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} but its location is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]], and the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary source of evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} and described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} However this also causes a problem as by definition anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]];{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}} Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}}

A further potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended the meeting were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Elizabeth Southerns died in prison while awaiting trial, and Alizon Device was among those found guilty and hanged at Gallows Hill in Lancaster on 20 August 1612.{{sfn|Hasted|1993|p=23|ps=}}

==History==
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}}

It is likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage, rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} &quot;Tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two others.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended the meeting were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Elizabeth Southerns died in prison while awaiting trial, and Alizon Device was among those found guilty and hanged at Gallows Hill in Lancaster on 20 August 1612.{{sfn|Hasted|1993|p=23|ps=}}

==History==
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}}

Despite its name, Malkin Tower was probably a simple cottage rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} &quot;Tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two others.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}

==Location==
Malkin Tower may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials,{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} but its location is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]], and the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary source of evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} and described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} However this also causes a problem as by definition anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]];{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}} Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}}

A further potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==History==
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}}

Despite its name, Malkin Tower was probably a simple cottage rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} &quot;Tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two others.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
Malkin Tower may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials,{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} but its location is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]], and the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary source of evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} and described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} However this also causes a problem as by definition anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]];{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}} Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}}

A further potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
Malkin Tower may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials,{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} but its location is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]], and the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary source of evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} and described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} However this also causes a problem as by definition anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]];{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}} Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}}

A further potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}}

Despite its name, Malkin Tower was probably a simple cottage rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} &quot;Tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}}

Despite its name, Malkin Tower was probably a simple cottage rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} &quot;Tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
Malkin Tower may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials,{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} but its location is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]], and the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary source of evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} and described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} However this also causes a problem as by definition anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]];{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}} Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}}

A further potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]], into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}}

Despite its name, Malkin Tower was probably a simple cottage rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} &quot;Tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} However, it has also been suggested that the building may have been part of a [[Normans|Norman]]-built [[peel tower]], originally constructed to protect the locals from attack by Scots.{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
Malkin Tower may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials,{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} but its location is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, Blacko. A Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower|alt=photograph]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]], and the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary source of evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} and described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} However this also causes a problem as by definition anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]];{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48}} Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}}

A further potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle (also known as Chattox) had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Despite its name, Malkin Tower was probably a simple cottage rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building was likely to have been no more than a hovel.{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} &quot;Tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It has also been suggested that the building may have been part of a [[Normans|Norman]]-built [[peel tower]], originally constructed to protect the locals from attack by the Scots.{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} In any case, it is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower, but were tenants of the property.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed in order to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, Blacko. A Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower|alt=photograph]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]], and the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary source of evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} and described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} However this also causes a problem as by definition anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at Bull Hole Farm near [[Sabden]].{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}} Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby.{{sfn|Peel|Southerns|1985|p=155|ps=}} However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed.

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle (also known as Chattox) had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Despite its name, Malkin Tower was probably a simple cottage rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building was likely to have been no more than a hovel.{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} &quot;Tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It has also been suggested that the building may have been part of a [[Normans|Norman]]-built [[peel tower]], originally constructed to protect the locals from attack by the Scots.{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} In any case, it is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower, but were tenants of the property.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed in order to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]], and the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary source of evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at Bull Hole Farm near [[Sabden]]. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle (also known as Chattox) had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Despite its name, Malkin Tower was probably a simple cottage rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building was likely to have been no more than a hovel.{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} &quot;Tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It has also been suggested that the building may have been part of a [[Normans|Norman]]-built [[peel tower]], originally constructed to protect the locals from attack by the Scots.{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} In any case, it is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower, but were tenants of the property.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed in order to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, Blacko, a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower|alt=photograph]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at Bull Hole Farm near [[Sabden]]. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court, [[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster|Thomas Potts]], who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle. Despite several archaeological excavations in the area no remains have yet been discovered.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage rather than a tower.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle (also known as Chattox) had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Despite its name, Malkin Tower was probably a simple cottage rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building was likely to have been no more than a hovel.{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} &quot;Tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It has also been suggested that the building may have been part of a [[Normans|Norman]]-built [[peel tower]], originally constructed to protect the locals from attack by the Scots.{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} In any case, it is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower, but were tenants of the property.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed in order to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, Blacko, a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower|alt=photograph]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at Bull Hole Farm near [[Sabden]]. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court, [[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster|Thomas Potts]], who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle. Despite several archaeological excavations in the area no remains have yet been discovered.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage rather than a tower.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle (also known as Chattox) had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Despite its name, Malkin Tower was probably a simple cottage rather than a tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building was likely to have been no more than a hovel.{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} &quot;Tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It has also been suggested that the building may have been part of a [[Normans|Norman]]-built [[peel tower]], originally constructed to protect the locals from attack by the Scots.{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} In any case, it is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower, but were tenants of the property.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed in order to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, Blacko, a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=photograph]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; title. It may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as defense from Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or possibly a disused poacher lookout.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} It is more likely that despite its name, Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W.

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court, [[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster|Thomas Potts]], who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle. Despite several archaeological excavations in the area no remains have yet been discovered.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage rather than a tower.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle (also known as Chattox) had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

{{quote|text=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil|sign=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.1633|source={{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; title. It may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as defense from Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or possibly a disused poacher lookout.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} It is more likely that despite its name, Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building was likely to have been no more than a hovel.{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} &quot;Tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} In any case, it is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower, but were tenants of the property.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed in order to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, Blacko, a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=photograph]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle (also known as Chattox) had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; title. It may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as defense from Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or possibly a disused poacher lookout.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} It is more likely that despite its name, Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building was likely to have been no more than a hovel.{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} &quot;Tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} In any case, it is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower, but were tenants of the property.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed in order to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, Blacko, a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=photograph]]

As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed in order to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, Blacko, a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=photograph]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court, [[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster|Thomas Potts]], who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle. Despite several archaeological excavations in the area no remains have yet been discovered.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage rather than a tower.

|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle (also known as Chattox) had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; title. It may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as defence from Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or possibly a disused poacher lookout.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} It is more likely, however, that despite its name, Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building was likely to have been no more than a hovel.{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} &quot;Tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} In any case, it is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower, but were tenants of the property.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial.

The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Elizabeth Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle (also known as Chattox) had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; title. It may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as defence from Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or possibly a disused poacher lookout.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} It is more likely, however, that despite its name, Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building was likely to have been no more than a hovel.{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} &quot;Tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} In any case, it is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower, but were tenants of the property.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed in order to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court, [[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster|Thomas Potts]], who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle. Despite several archaeological excavations in the area no remains have yet been discovered.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage rather than a tower.

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court, [[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster|Thomas Potts]], who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle. Despite several archaeological excavations in the area no remains have yet been discovered.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage rather than a tower.

===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}

The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle (also known as Chattox) had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; title. It may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as defence from Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or possibly a disused poacher lookout.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} It is more likely, however, that despite its name, Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building was likely to have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} In any case, it is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower, but were tenants of the property.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed in order to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, Blacko, a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=photograph]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde {{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court, [[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster|Thomas Potts]], who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle. Despite several archaeological excavations in the area no remains have yet been discovered.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage rather than a tower.

The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle (also known as Chattox) had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; title. It may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as defence from Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or possibly a disused poacher lookout.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} It is more likely, however, that despite its name, Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building was likely to have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} In any case, it is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower, but were tenants of the property.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed in order to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, Blacko, a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=photograph]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations around the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle (also known as Chattox) had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; title. It may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as defence from Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or possibly a disused poacher lookout.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} It is more likely, however, that despite its name, Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building was likely to have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} In any case, it is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower, but were tenants of the property.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed in order to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, Blacko, a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would be outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have taken place in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial.

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage rather than a tower.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle (also known as Chattox) had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; title. It may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as defence from Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or possibly a disused poacher lookout.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} It is more likely, however, that despite its name, Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building was likely to have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} In any case, it is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower, but were tenants of the property.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed in order to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle (also known as Chattox) had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; title. It may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as defence from Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or possibly a disused poacher lookout.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} It is more likely, however, that despite its name, Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W.

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed in order to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court, [[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster|Thomas Potts]], who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle. Despite several archaeological excavations in the area no remains have yet been discovered.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage rather than a tower.

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten.

Despite several archaeological excavations in the area no remains have yet been discovered.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage rather than a tower.

The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle (also known as Chattox) had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; title. It may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as defence from Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or possibly a disused poacher lookout.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} It is more likely, however, that despite its name, Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building was likely to have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} In any case, it is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower, but were tenants of the property.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a smallholding that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed in order to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, Blacko, a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten.

Despite several archaeological excavations in the area no remains have yet been discovered.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage rather than a tower.

==History==

{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle (also known as Chattox) had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; title. It may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as defence from Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or possibly a disused poacher lookout.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} It is more likely, however, that despite its name, Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building was likely to have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} In any case, it is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower, but were tenants of the property.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, Blacko, a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot;, or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle (also known as Chattox) had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; title. It may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as defence from Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or possibly a disused poacher lookout.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} It is more likely, however, that despite its name, Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building was likely to have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} In any case, it is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower, but were tenants of the property.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, Blacko, a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, Blacko, a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in one of the field walls is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century halmote court records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls, close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle (also known as Chattox) had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; title. It may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as defence from Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or possibly a disused poacher lookout.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} It is more likely, however, that despite its name, Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building was likely to have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court, [[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster|Thomas Potts]], who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle. Despite several archaeological excavations in the area, no confirmed remains have been discovered.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage.

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court, [[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster|Thomas Potts]], who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle. Despite several archaeological excavations in the area, no confirmed remains have been discovered.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage.

The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle (also known as Chattox) had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; title. It may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as defence from Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or possibly a disused poacher lookout.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} It is more likely, however, that despite its name, Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building was likely to have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was not uncommon at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; title. It may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as defence from Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or possibly a disused poacher lookout.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} It is more likely, however, that despite its name, Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W.

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The account of the trials written by [[Thomas Potts (clerk of court)|Thomas Potts]], clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, Blacko, a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in a field wall is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manor court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; title. It may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as defence from Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or possibly a disused poacher lookout.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} It is more likely, however, that despite its name, Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R.

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]] that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, Blacko, a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in a field wall is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manor court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3}} which had been disafforested in 1507{{sfn|Awain|1986|p=9}}}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in a field wall is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manor court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court, [[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster|Thomas Potts]], who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle. Despite several archaeological excavations in the area, no confirmed remains have been discovered.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle (also known as Chattox) had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; title. It may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as defence from Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or possibly a disused poacher lookout.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} It is more likely, however, that despite its name, Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building was likely to have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3}} which had been disafforested in 1507.{{sfn|Awain|1986|p=9}}}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle (also known as Chattox) had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; title. It may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as defence from Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or possibly a disused poacher lookout.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} It is more likely, however, that despite its name, Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building was likely to have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3}} which was disafforested in 1507.{{sfn|Awain|1986|p=9}}}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, Blacko, a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in a field wall is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manor court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court, [[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster|Thomas Potts]], who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle. Despite several archaeological excavations in the area, no confirmed remains have been discovered.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage.

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court, [[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster|Thomas Potts]], who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle. Despite several archaeological excavations in the area, no confirmed remains have been discovered.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage.

|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle (also known as Chattox) had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; title. It may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as defence from Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or possibly a disused poacher lookout.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} It is more likely, however, that despite its name, Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building was likely to have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507.{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}}}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, Blacko, a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in a field wall is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed.

The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court, [[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster|Thomas Potts]], who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle. Despite several archaeological excavations in the area, no confirmed remains have been discovered.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage.

|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle (also known as Chattox) had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; title. It may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as defence from Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or possibly a disused poacher lookout.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} It is more likely, however, that despite its name, Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building was likely to have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507.{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}}}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, Blacko, a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in a field wall is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507.{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}}}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in a field wall is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle. Several archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle (also known as Chattox) had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; title. It may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as defence from Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or possibly a disused poacher lookout.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} It is more likely, however, that despite its name, Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building was likely to have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507.{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}}}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle (also known as Chattox) had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; title. It may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as defence from Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or possibly a disused poacher lookout.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} It is more likely, however, that despite its name, Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building was likely to have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507.{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}}}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, Blacko, a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in a field wall is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage.

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage.

|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appelation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building was likely to have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may therefore have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507.{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}}}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, Blacko, a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in a field wall is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage.

|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appelation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507.{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}}}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, Blacko, a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in a field wall is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial, such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others related to the trials were also known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, while John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. However, neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507.{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}}}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in a field wall is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others caught up in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appelation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507.{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}}}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appelation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507.{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}}}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in a field wall is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others caught up in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage.

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appelation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507.{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}}}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in a field wall is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others caught up in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appelation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in a field wall is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others caught up in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in a field wall is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others caught up in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appelation{{clarify|reason=appelation word makes no sense here|date=September 2012}}. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage.

The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in a field wall is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others caught up in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed.

The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in a field wall is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others caught up in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in a field wall is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others caught up in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who says simply that it was in the Forest of Pendle. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in a field wall is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged sightings of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others caught up in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who says simply that it was in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage.

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witch's coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who says simply that it was in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in a field wall is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged reports of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==

|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in a field wall is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged reports of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} old masonry found in a field wall is said to be from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfn|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged reports of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who says simply that it was in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who says simply that it was in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower was likely to have been a simple cottage.

The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Potts|1848|pp=xlix–l|loc=intoroduction footnote|ps=}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfn|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. And the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged reports of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage complete with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those who attended were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who only says that it was in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Potts|1848|pp=xlix–l|loc=intoroduction footnote|ps=}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfn|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. And the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged reports of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Potts|1848|pp=xlix–l|loc=intoroduction footnote|ps=}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfn|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. And the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Around 1890, Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.  Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|pp=265-266|ps=}}  Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, John A Clayton suggests that aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|pp=265-266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged reports of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those attending were arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who only says that it was in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who only says that it was in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their &quot;fire house&quot;.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Potts|1848|pp=xlix–l|loc=intoroduction footnote|ps=}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfn|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. And the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Around 1890, Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.  Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|pp=265-266|ps=}}  Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, John A Clayton suggests that aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|pp=265-266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged reports of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were subsequently arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Potts|1848|pp=xlix–l|loc=intoroduction footnote|ps=}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfn|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It is suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle. And the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Around 1890, Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.  Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|pp=265-266|ps=}}  Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, John A Clayton suggests that aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|pp=265-266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged reports of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who only says that it was in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who only says that it was in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Potts|1848|pp=xlix–l|loc=intoroduction footnote|ps=}}{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfn|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Around 1890, Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.  Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|pp=265-266|ps=}}  Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, John A Clayton suggests that aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|pp=265-266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged reports of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

Around 1890, Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.  Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|pp=265-266|ps=}}  Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|pp=265-266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged reports of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who only says that it was in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were arrested and detained in Lancaster Gaol, along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up Lancaster Castle. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

Around 1890, Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.  Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged reports of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who only says that it was in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Potts|1848|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfn|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

Around 1890, Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.  Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged reports of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged reports of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Potts|1848|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfn|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous alleged reports of witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W.

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Potts|1848|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfn|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead, [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Potts|1848|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfn|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were respectively charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]].

But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word &quot;Malkin&quot;, but despite its name Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==

|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W.

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

==History==

{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name &quot;Malkin&quot; has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name &quot;Mary&quot;, or &quot;Maud&quot;, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar &quot;mawkin&quot; was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} &quot;Malkin&quot; was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in &quot;[[grimalkin]]&quot; or &quot;grey malkin&quot;,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of &quot;mal&quot; and &quot;kin&quot; as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the &quot;Tower&quot; appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and &quot;tower&quot; may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Potts|1848|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfn|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfn|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfn|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]].

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'', but despite its name Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name ''Mary'', or ''Maud'', and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in ''[[grimalkin]]'' or grey malkin,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female name ''Mary'', or ''Maud'', and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in ''[[grimalkin]]'' or ''grey malkin'',{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Potts|1848|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfn|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfn|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfn|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial.

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfn|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfn|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'', but despite its name Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfn|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfn|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfn|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfn|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfn|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfn|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfn|Potts|1848|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfn|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfn|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfn|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfn|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfn|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfn|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfn|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfn|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfn|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfn|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfn|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfn|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'', but despite its name Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'', but despite its name Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[|malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. When Nowell learned of the meeting he concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1848|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house was demolished shortly after the trials and forgotten. The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'', but despite its name Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W.

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

The only firm evidence of its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]].

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'', but despite its name Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1848|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial.

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1848|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed; the house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'', but despite its name Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower'''{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or '''Mocking Tower''',{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'', but despite its name Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br/&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1848|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower, {{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower,{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}} The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1848|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed; the house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'', but despite its name Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed; the house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'', but despite its name Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br /&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon Device had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after meeting Alizon, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both she and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1848|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1848|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed; the house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'', but despite its name Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br /&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
Malkkin Tower was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after refusing to sell Alizon some pins, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both Alizon and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
Malkkin Tower was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after refusing to sell Alizon some pins, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both Alizon and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1848|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed; the house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'', but despite its name Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br /&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after refusing to sell Alizon some pins, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both Alizon and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by witchcraft, seven of whom were found guilty and executed; the house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'', but despite its name Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|The value of goods stolen was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W.

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612.

Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'', but despite its name Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by Alizon Device's claim that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|The value of goods stolen was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after refusing to sell Alizon some pins, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both Alizon and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after refusing to sell Alizon some pins, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both Alizon and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed; the house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'' but, despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed; the house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'' but, despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br /&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|The value of goods stolen was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after refusing to sell Alizon some pins, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both Alizon and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions Malking Tower many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612.

Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'' but, despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|The value of goods stolen was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after refusing to sell Alizon some pins, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both Alizon and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from Halifax, she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after refusing to sell Alizon some pins, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both Alizon and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after examining Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed; the house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'' but, despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed; the house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'' but, despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br /&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after refusing to sell Alizon some pins, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both Alizon and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed; the house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'' but, despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after refusing to sell Alizon some pins, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both Alizon and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

===Association with witches===

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after refusing to sell Alizon some pins, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both Alizon and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed; the house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'' but, despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed; the house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'' but, despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br /&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after refusing to sell Alizon some pins, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both Alizon and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed; the house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'' but, despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br /&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after refusing to sell Alizon some pins, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both Alizon and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after refusing to sell Alizon some pins, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both Alizon and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed; the house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'' but, despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed; the house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'' but, despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br /&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after refusing to sell Alizon some pins, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both Alizon and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed; the house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'' but, despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or 'slut'.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after refusing to sell Alizon some pins, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both Alizon and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after refusing to sell Alizon some pins, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both Alizon and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]].

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed; the house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'' but, despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk to the court Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'' but, despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br /&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or 'slut'.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after refusing to sell Alizon some pins, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both Alizon and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin'' but, despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or 'slut'.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}
On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after refusing to sell Alizon some pins, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both Alizon and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

===Association with witches===

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; As a consequence of a chance encounter Alizon had on 21 March 1612 with John Law, a pedlar from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], she and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate Roger Nowell on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft; Law had collapsed shortly after refusing to sell Alizon some pins, and his son had accused her of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both Alizon and her grandmother were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}} Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and concluded after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br /&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or 'slut'.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}} 

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; 

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or 'slut'.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}} 

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; 

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}} 

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt; 

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br /&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' who smell [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings such as outdoor toilets, that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches', who smell, in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches',such as the witch of endor, who smells, in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br /&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' is not real has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings such as outdoor toilets, that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' is not real has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings such as outdoor toilets, that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' eg the witch of endor trial in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' (e.g. the witch of endor) trial in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br /&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' is not real has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings such as outdoor toilets, that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' trial in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' is not real has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings such as outdoor toilets, that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' trial in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' trial in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br /&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' is not real has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used for 'a lower-class woman' or 'slut'.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings such as outdoor toilets, that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' trial in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

The name ''Malkin'' is not real has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings such as outdoor toilets, that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' trial in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' trial in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br /&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings such as outdoor toilets, that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' trial in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br /&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used for 'a lower-class woman' or 'slut'.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings such as outdoor toilets, that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' trial in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used for 'a lower-class woman' or 'slut'.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire.

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings such as outdoor toilets, that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower.

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm.

But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' trial in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' trial in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br /&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used for 'a lower-class woman' or 'slut'.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings such as outdoor toilets, that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' trial in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' trial in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used for 'a lower-class woman' or 'slut'.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings such as outdoor toilets, that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial.

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' trial in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br /&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used for 'a lower-class woman' or 'slut'.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings such as outdoor toilets, that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' trial in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used for 'a lower-class woman' or 'slut'.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings such as outdoor toilets, that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is pickle
.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' trial in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br /&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used for 'a lower-class woman' or 'slut'.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings such as outdoor toilets, that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used for 'a lower-class woman' or 'slut'.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings such as outdoor toilets, that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation.

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==History==
===Toponymy===
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br /&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used for 'a lower-class woman' or 'slut'.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used for 'a lower-class woman' or 'slut'.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

===Association with witches===
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

==Association with witches==
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''', sometimes called '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''', was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==Toponymy==
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br /&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used for 'a lower-class woman' or 'slut'.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

==Association with witches==
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''' (or the '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''') was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used for 'a lower-class woman' or 'slut'.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

==Association with witches==
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

==Association with witches==
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''' (or the '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''') was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''' (or the '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''') was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==Toponymy==
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br /&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

==Association with witches==
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 6 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 6 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''' (or the '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''') was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

==Association with witches==
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 10 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

==Association with witches==
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 10 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''' (or the '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''') was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612.{{efn|All dates in this article are given in the [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] consistent with the [[Julian Calendar]] in use in England until 1752, when the [[Gregorian calendar was adopted.}. Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''' (or the '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''') was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612.{{efn|All dates in this article are given in the [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] consistent with the [[Julian Calendar]] in use in England until 1752, when the [[Gregorian calendar was adopted.}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==Toponymy==
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br /&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

==Association with witches==
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 10 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

'''Malkin Tower''' (or the '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''') was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612.{{efn|All dates in this article are given in the [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] consistent with the [[Julian Calendar]] in use in England until 1752, when the [[Gregorian calendar was adopted.}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed.

|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

==Association with witches==
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 10 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

==Association with witches==
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 10 April 1612, Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''' (or the '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''') was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612.{{efn|All dates in this article are given in the [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] consistent with the [[Julian Calendar]] in use in England until 1752, when the [[Gregorian calendar]] was adopted.}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

[[File:Upper and Lower Black Moss Reservoir - geograph.org.uk - 106540.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss Reservoir]] (on the left), one of the  suggested sites for the location of Malkin Tower|alt=rolling unwooded landscape]]
'''Malkin Tower''' (or the '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''') was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612.{{efn|All dates in this article are given in the [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] consistent with the [[Julian Calendar]] in use in England until 1752, when the [[Gregorian calendar]] was adopted.}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==Toponymy==
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br /&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

==Association with witches==
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 10 April 1612,{{sfnp|Sharpe|2002|p=2|ps=}} Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

'''Malkin Tower''' (or the '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''') was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612.{{efn|All dates in this article are given in the [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] consistent with the [[Julian Calendar]] in use in England until 1752, when the [[Gregorian calendar]] was adopted.}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed.

|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

==Association with witches==
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 10 April 1612,{{sfnp|Sharpe|2002|p=2|ps=}} Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

On [[Good Friday]], 10 April 1612,{{sfnp|Sharpe|2002|p=2|ps=}} Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the most well-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial.

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''' (or the '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''') was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612.{{efn|All dates in this article are given in the [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] consistent with the [[Julian Calendar]] in use in England until 1752, when the [[Gregorian calendar]] was adopted.}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

'''Malkin Tower''' (or the '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''') was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612.{{efn|All dates in this article are given in the [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] consistent with the [[Julian Calendar]] in use in England until 1752, when the [[Gregorian calendar]] was adopted.}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

==Toponymy==
{{Quote box |width=28em |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center |quote=Malkin's Tower, a little cottage where&lt;br /&gt;Reporte makes caitive witches meete to swear&lt;br/&gt;Their homage to ye devil.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=273|ps=}}
|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

==Association with witches==
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 10 April 1612,{{sfnp|Sharpe|2002|p=2|ps=}} Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the best-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

'''Malkin Tower''' (or the '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''') was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

|source=[[Richard James (scholar)|Richard James]] c.&amp;nbsp;1633}}
The name ''Malkin'' has several possible derivations: it was a familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a term for a poor or shabby woman;{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} the similar ''mawkin'' was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} ''Malkin'' was also used as a term for a cat, particularly an old cat, as in [[grimalkin]] or grey malkin,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} and was an old northern English name for a [[hare]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} into which witches were said to be able to transfigure.&lt;ref name=&quot;PrestonChronicle&quot;/&gt; It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of ''mal'' and ''kin'' as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower,{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Another possibility is a corruption of [[malt house|malt kiln]],{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=154|ps=}}{{efn|A fire house was used in the final stage of converting barley into malt for use in brewing, by heating it up over a slow fire. The value of goods stolen from Demdike's fire house was about £1,{{sfn|Swain|2002|p=80|ps=}} equivalent to about £100 as of 2008.&lt;ref name=CC&gt;{{citation |title=Currency converter |publisher=The National Archives |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/currency/ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Authors have speculated on a range of buildings that could account for the ''Tower'' appellation. Malkin Tower may have incorporated a [[Normans|Norman]] [[peel tower]], built as a defence against Scottish raiders{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} or might have been a disused poacher's lookout,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=268|ps=}} but it is more likely that despite its name Malkin Tower was a simple cottage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt; Historian W. R. Mitchell suggests that it was originally a small farm building, perhaps a shelter for fodder or livestock, which was converted into poor-quality living accommodation.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} Poverty was not uncommon among the residents of the Forest of Pendle, hence the building may have been no more than a hovel,{{sfnp|Eyre|1986|p=13|ps=}} and ''tower'' may have been a sarcastic name given by local residents.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}} It is almost certain that Southerns and Device did not own Malkin Tower but were tenants.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155}}

Malkin Tower is sometimes alternatively referred to as Malking Tower,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=37|ps=}} or Mocking Tower.{{sfnp|Poole|2002|p=13|ps=}}

==Association with witches==
{{main|Pendle witches}}

On [[Good Friday]], 10 April 1612,{{sfnp|Sharpe|2002|p=2|ps=}} Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the best-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]]. Nowell learned of the meeting and, after interrogating Alizon Device's &quot;mentally sub-normal&quot; brother, James, concluded that Malkin Tower had been the scene of a witches' coven, and that all who had attended were witches.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|pp=16–18|ps=}} Eight were subsequently accused of causing harm by witchcraft and committed for trial, seven at [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] [[Assizes]] and one at York.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}}

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial. The other members of the family lived in a [[smallholding]] that had belonged to John Device, Elizabeth Device's deceased husband.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}}}} The building may also have been destroyed to eradicate the &quot;melancholy associations&quot; of the place.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=156|ps=}} The official account of the trials written by Thomas Potts, clerk to the court, in his ''[[The Wonderfull Discoverie of Witches in the Countie of Lancaster]]'' mentions ''Malking Tower'' many times, but only describes it as being in the Forest of Pendle, a former [[royal forest]]{{efn|name=HonourOfClitheroe|Pendle Forest was part of the [[Honour of Clitheroe]],{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=3|ps=}} which was disafforested in 1507,{{sfnp|Swain|1986|p=9|ps=}} although the land remained a part of the [[Duchy of Lancaster]] until 1660.}} that covered a considerable area south and east of [[Pendle Hill]], extending almost to the towns of [[Burnley]], [[Colne]] and [[Padiham]].

[[File:Blacko Tower - geograph.org.uk - 1138193.jpg|right|thumb|Stansfield Tower, [[Blacko]], a Victorian [[folly]] often confused with Malkin Tower{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=157|ps=}}|alt=Prominent structure on a hill]]
One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

On [[Good Friday]], 10 April 1612,{{sfnp|Sharpe|2002|p=2|ps=}} Malkin Tower was the venue for perhaps the best-known alleged witches' coven in English legal history.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=22|ps=}} The house was home to Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike,{{efn|name=Demdike|&quot;Demdike&quot; is derived from &quot;devil woman&quot;, suggesting that Elizabeth Southerns was &quot;feared and loathed within the community&quot;.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=204|ps=}}}} and her granddaughter Alizon Device,{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=38|ps=}} two of the alleged Pendle witches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Executions&quot;/&gt;

On 21 March 1612 Alizon had a chance encounter with John Law, a [[peddler|pedlar]] from [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], who refused to sell her some pins. Law collapsed shortly afterwards and his son accused Alizon of being responsible.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} She and her grandmother were summoned to the home of local magistrate, Roger Nowell, on suspicion of causing harm by witchcraft.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=10|ps=}} Both were arrested and detained in [[Lancaster Castle#Gaol|Lancaster Gaol]], along with two other women.{{sfnp|Bennett|1993|p=16|ps=}}  Friends of the Demdike family met at Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612, allegedly to plot the escape of the four gaoled women by blowing up [[Lancaster Castle]].

==Location==
The location of Malkin Tower is uncertain.{{sfnp|Froome|2010|p=39|ps=}} It may have been demolished shortly after the 1612 trials, as it was common at the time to dismantle empty buildings and recycle the materials.{{efn|name=Empty|The building accommodated only Alizon Device and her grandmother; Alizon was hanged and her grandmother died in prison awaiting trial.

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}

'''Malkin Tower''' (or the '''Malking Tower''' or '''Mocking Tower''') was the home of Elizabeth Southerns, also known as Demdike, and her granddaughter Alizon Device, two of the chief protagonists in the [[Pendle witches|Lancashire witch trials]] of 1612.

Perhaps the best-known alleged witches' [[coven]] in English legal history took place in Malkin Tower on 10 April 1612.{{efn|All dates in this article are given in the [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] consistent with the [[Julian Calendar]] in use in England until 1752, when the [[Gregorian calendar]] was adopted.}} Eight of those attending were subsequently arrested and tried for causing harm by [[witchcraft]], seven of whom were found guilty and executed. The house may have been demolished shortly after the trials. The only firm evidence for its location comes from the official account by the clerk of the court, Thomas Potts, who places it somewhere in the [[Forest of Pendle]]. Archaeological excavations in the area have failed to discover any confirmed remains of the building.

Several explanations have been suggested for the origins of the word ''Malkin''.  Despite its name, Malkin Tower is likely to have been a simple cottage.

One contender is in the civil parish of [[Blacko]], on the site of present-day Malkin Tower Farm;{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} since the 1840s claims have been made that old masonry found in a field wall is from the remains of the building.{{sfnp|Catlow|1986|pp=13–14|ps=}}{{sfnp|Potts|1845|pp=xlix–l|loc=introduction footnote|ps=}} In ''The Lancashire Witch-Craze'', Jonathan Lumby conjectures that the building was situated on the moors surrounding Blacko Hill, near to an old road between Colne and [[Gisburn]].{{sfnp|Lumby|1995|p=19|ps=}} Local folklore in the parish holds that the remains of Malkin Tower are buried in a field behind the nearby Cross Gaits Inn [[public house]]; the tower used to be featured on the inn's sign.{{sfnp|Davitt|2006|p=22|ps=}} The primary evidence supporting this location seems to be that a hollow in the hillside east of the farm is known as Mawkin Hole.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=279|ps=}} It has been suggested that this is the same place mentioned in the 16th-century [[manorial court|halmote court]] records for the [[manor]] of Colne as Mawkin Yarde,{{efn|name=Mawkin|Spelt variously: Malkynyerd, Malkenyerd, Malkynyerde, Mawkyn-yarde, Mawkin Yarde.{{sfnp|Farrer|1897|pp=237, 266, 241, 458, 466|ps=}}}} described as being &quot;in the north of Colne&quot;,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=286|ps=}} but anywhere inside the manor of Colne would have been outside the Forest of Pendle, and the first Ordnance Survey map of the area, created in the 1840s, identifies the farm as Blacko Tower.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS&quot;/&gt; The site is also several miles from any of the traceable locations mentioned at the trial.{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}}

In 1891, local grocer Jonathan Stansfield constructed a solitary tower on the nearby summit of Blacko Hill.{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=148|ps=}} Today this is also commonly known as Blacko Tower, and is often confused with Malkin Tower. Although he claimed at the time that he wished to see into neighbouring valleys, historian John Clayton suggests that, aware of the story, he may have wished to provide the area with his own version.{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|pp=265–266|ps=}}

Another possible location is somewhere near the village of [[Newchurch in Pendle]].{{sfnp|Fields|1998|p=60|ps=}} Douglas claims there is &quot;persuasive&quot; evidence that an area near Sadler's Farm (now known as Shekinah Christian Centre) was the site of Malkin Tower; there were numerous reports of alleged witchcraft in the area, and it was in the vicinity of other locations named during the trial such as Greenhead,{{efn|name=Greenhead|Greenhead, near [[Fence, Lancashire|Fence]], was the home of Christopher Nutter and his son Robert,{{sfnp|Clayton|2007|p=79|ps=}} for whose deaths Anne Whittle and Anne Redferne were charged with murder during the Pendle witch trials.{{sfnp|Davies|1971|p=34|ps=}}{{sfnp|Hasted|1993|p=33|ps=}}}} [[Barley, Lancashire|Barley]] and [[Roughlee]].{{sfnp|Douglas|1978|pp=47–48|ps=}} Others involved in the trials were known to have lived in the area; alleged witches Jane and John Bulcock resided at Moss End Farm in Newchurch, and John Nutter, whose cows were claimed to have been bewitched, lived at the neighbouring Bull Hole Farm. Southerns' son Christopher Holgate also lived nearby. But neither the deeds of Sadler's Farm, which date back to the 17th century, nor contemporary maps of the region mention Malkin Tower or any fields in which it may have stood.{{sfnp|Peel|Southern|1985|p=155|ps=}}

Archaeological excavations have been undertaken in several locations in the Pendle Forest area, including Newchurch, but nothing has been found.{{sfnp|Mitchell|1984|p=25|ps=}} A potential candidate for the lost Malkin Tower was announced in December 2011, after water engineers unearthed a 17th-century cottage with a mummified cat sealed in the walls,{{efn|name=MummifiedCats|The spirits of dead cats were believed to protect household food supplies from vermin such as rats and mice.{{sfnp|Froome|p=161|2010|ps=}}}} close to [[Black Moss Reservoirs|Lower Black Moss reservoir]] near Barley.&lt;ref name=&quot;MalkinTower&quot;/&gt;{{-}}
